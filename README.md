# Overview

As a software engineer, my primary goal is continuous learning and improvement. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript by building a web application that interacts with the Unsplash API to fetch and display images, handle search functionalities, and enable image downloads. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript language features, asynchronous programming, and working with APIs.

## Description

The software I developed is a web application that utilizes JavaScript, Node.js with Express, and Axios for making HTTP requests to the Unsplash API. It features a responsive image grid where users can browse random images or search for specific ones based on keywords. The application supports pagination, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of search results. It also includes functionality for downloading images, which involves notifying the API and handling the download process client-side.

## Purpose

The purpose of developing this software was to enhance my skills in JavaScript programming and web development. By working on this project, I aimed to:
- Solidify my understanding of JavaScript syntax and asynchronous operations.
- Gain practical experience in integrating with third-party APIs and handling API responses.
- Improve my proficiency in front-end development with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Showcase my ability to build a responsive and functional web application.
